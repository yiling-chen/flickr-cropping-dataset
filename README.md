## Flickr Image Cropping Dataset

This repository contains the dataset used in the following paper:

[Yi-Ling Chen](https://yiling-chen.github.io/), Tzu-Wei Huang, Kai-Han Chang, Yu-Chen Tsai, [Hwann-Tzong Chen](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~htchen/), [Bing-Yu Chen](http://graphics.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~robin/). (2017). ["Quantitative Analysis of Automatic Image Cropping Algorithms:A Dataset and Comparative Study"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01480). IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2017.

## Download the dataset

1. Clone the repository to your local disk.
2. Under a command line terminal, run the following commands to get the images with cropping annotations:
```bash
$ cd scripts/
$ python download_images.py -w 4
```
The above command will launch 4 worker thread to download the images to a pre-defined folder (../data) from Flickr. Check out the code to see how to change the default folder. If you want to get the images with ranking annotation, run the following command instead.
```bash
$ python download_ranking_images -w 4
```

**Update:** Since many Flickr images in this dataset are no longer available for download, I am sharing my local copy via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11R4przja3GE3j36wrtMSovvHMuw-oeOn/view?usp=sharing). Please note that these images are intended for research purposes only.


## Annotation

1. Cropping: `cropping_training_set.json` and `cropping_testing_set.json` contain the cropping annotations of this dataset. The annotations are saved as an array of JSON dictionaries. Each dictionary includes the information of one image. See the following for an example.

```json
[
    {
        "url":"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4096/4910188666_04cf9f487d_b.jpg",
        "flickr_photo_id":4910188666,
        "crop":[
            266,
            6,
            757,
            399
        ]
    },
]
```

2. Ranking: `ranking_annotation.json` contain the ranking annotations of this dataset. The annotations are saved as an array of JSON dictionaries. Each dictionary includes the information of one image. Each image contains ten crop pairs. The crop with more votes is more visually pleasing than the other one. See the following for an example.

```json
[
    {
        "url":"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2946/15251367120_9bdca6b5c3_c.jpg",
        "crops":[
            {
                "vote_for_1":1,
                "vote_for_0":4,
                "crop_1":[
                    171,
                    281,
                    300,
                    400
                ],
                "crop_0":[
                    139,
                    234,
                    300,
                    400
                ]
            },
        ],
        "flickr_photo_id":15251367120
    },
]
```

## Evaluation
For a completely fair comparison with the baselines reported in the paper, you may want to evaluate your image cropper with the same sliding windows as specified in `sliding_window.json`.
